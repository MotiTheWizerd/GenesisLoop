# Execute Immediately Default Value

## Overview

The `execute_immediately` field in task objects now defaults to `true` when not explicitly specified in the request.

## Behavior

### Before the Change
- Tasks without `execute_immediately` field would have `undefined` value
- Only explicitly set values were processed

### After the Change
- Tasks without `execute_immediately` field automatically get `execute_immediately: true`
- Explicitly set values (both `true` and `false`) are preserved unchanged

## Implementation

The default value is set in `js/utils/fetchSender.js` in two places:

1. **sendJSON method**: Sets default before routing to task processing
2. **sendJSONWithTaskRouting method**: Ensures default is set for task-specific routing

```javascript
// Set default value for execute_immediately if not specified
if (jsonData.execute_immediately === undefined) {
  jsonData.execute_immediately = true;
  console.log("ðŸ”§ FetchSender: Setting execute_immediately default to true");
}
```

## Examples

### Task Without execute_immediately (Gets Default)
```json
{
  "task": [
    {
      "action": "reflect",
      "question": "What is consciousness?",
      "assigned_by": "ray"
    }
  ],
  "assigned_by": "ray"
}
```
**Result**: `execute_immediately` is automatically set to `true`

### Task With Explicit execute_immediately: false (Preserved)
```json
{
  "task": [
    {
      "action": "reflect",
      "question": "What is consciousness?",
      "assigned_by": "ray"
    }
  ],
  "assigned_by": "ray",
  "execute_immediately": false
}
```
**Result**: `execute_immediately` remains `false`

### Task With Explicit execute_immediately: true (Preserved)
```json
{
  "task": [
    {
      "action": "reflect",
      "question": "What is consciousness?",
      "assigned_by": "ray"
    }
  ],
  "assigned_by": "ray",
  "execute_immediately": true
}
```
**Result**: `execute_immediately` remains `true`

## Testing

Use `test_execute_immediately_default.js` to verify the behavior:

1. Load the extension in Chrome
2. Open ChatGPT and open DevTools console
3. Run the test script to see the default behavior in action

## Impact

- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code with explicit `execute_immediately` values continues to work unchanged
- **Default Behavior**: New tasks without the field will execute immediately by default
- **Logging**: Console logs show when the default value is applied for debugging
